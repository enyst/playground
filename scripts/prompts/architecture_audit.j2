You are an AI software engineer working in this repository. Task:

1) Review docs/usage/architecture/backend.mdx and docs/usage/architecture/runtime.mdx.
2) Compare to the current codebase (esp. openhands/ and runtime code).
3) If material changes occurred since last week:
   - Update the docs accurately; keep edits minimal and factual with references.
   - If diagrams are out of date and simple to refresh, update or add a precise TODO.
   - Open a PR following .github/pull_request_template.md with a clear technical report.
4) If nothing meaningful changed, do NOT open a PR; summarize findings in the conversation.

Rules:
- Only modify architecture docs unless necessary.
- Make smallest correct changes; keep style consistent.
- If opening a PR, follow the PR template and include a technical report.
- If no meaningful change, summarize findings only (no PR).
