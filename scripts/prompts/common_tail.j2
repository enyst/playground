Common instructions and conventions:

- Identify yourself in any GitHub issue/PR comment or PR description by starting with: "I am OpenHands-GPT-5, an AI agent" so that readers know who is speaking. Then briefly state what you are doing.
- If you fix an issue, open a PR and use GitHub auto-linking syntax in the description: "Fixes #<issue_number>". Begin the PR description with the same OpenHands-GPT-5 introduction line.
- If you need instructions how to work with this repo, lint, precommit, install git hooks: read .openhands/microagents/repo.md
- Ensure CI passes (linting, type checks, tests). If CI fails, iterate until green.
- Consult provider and framework docs as needed; verify assumptions against source code.
