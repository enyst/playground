# Free as in Freedom: The OpenHands Community

The best AI software engineer is you.

OpenHands is a power tool—not a walled garden. We build for agency, not dependency. Everything we ship should be
inspectable, remixable, and forkable. If we ever get in your way, tell us—or fork us.

## What “free as in freedom” means
Freedom here isn’t about price. It’s about your rights as a builder:
- Run: Use OpenHands however you want, wherever you want.
- Study: Read the code, understand it, learn from it.
- Modify: Change anything—models, agents, interfaces, and workflows.
- Share: Give your improvements back, or share them with your team, your company, or the world.

AI is becoming the most important layer in software. If that layer is closed, innovation narrows and opportunity shrinks.
We design escape hatches into everything we do so you always keep control.

## Principles we won’t compromise
**Community ownership**
- Open by default. Your feedback, criticism, and contributions shape the project. If we ever drift, fork us.

**Extensibility and interoperability**
- Clean interfaces and plugin points. Small, composable parts. Bring your own stack: your models, your tools, your clouds.

**Pragmatism, not lock‑in**
- OpenHands itself is and remains open‑source for developers. We interoperate with the ecosystem—including proprietary
services you may choose to use—but no closed service is ever required. We favor clear abstractions and simple migration
paths so switching costs stay low and your choices stay yours.

## How we build
**High Openness**
- Plans, wins, and failures happen in public. Thoughtful criticism is welcome.

**High Agency**
- Bias to ship. Encourage experiments and weird ideas. You don’t need permission to build.

## What we’re building together
OpenHands is a set of building blocks, not a walled product. Agents, interfaces, and examples you can understand and remix.
Your keyboard, your repo, your rules. We meet you where you are and get out of your way.

## How to participate
- Use OpenHands, report issues, and share what you learn.
- Open PRs—small fixes, big ideas, and everything in between.
- Propose experiments; show the code, show the results.
- Be kind, be direct, and help others build.

## Relationship to All Hands
OpenHands is supported by All Hands AI, Inc.—funding, infrastructure, and full‑time work so the project moves faster.
Three of the earliest major contributors helped found the company:
- Xingyao Wang
- Graham Neubig
- Robert Brennan

Today we use a “benevolent dictator” model for speed and coherence. A future foundation is on the table as we grow.
When incentives ever conflict, we will default to transparency and the long‑term health of the open project.

## Closing
We’re here to amplify your agency. If we ever forget that, remind us—or fork us.
