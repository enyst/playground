# Free as in Freedom: The OpenHands Community

OpenHands exists to advance Open Source AI—free as in freedom

OpenHands is a power tool—not a walled garden. We build for agency, not dependency. Everything we ship should be
inspectable, remixable, and forkable. If we ever get in your way, tell us—or fork us.

## Why Open Source AI matters
AI is becoming the most important layer in software. If that layer is closed, innovation narrows and opportunity
shrinks. OpenHands treats AI tooling as public infrastructure: inspectable, remixable, and forkable—with escape hatches
built in so you always keep control.

## Our design commitments
**Community ownership**
- Open by default. Your feedback, criticism, and contributions shape the project. If we ever drift, fork us.

**No lock‑in by design**
- OpenHands is open‑source for developers. We interoperate with the ecosystem—including proprietary services you might
choose—but nothing closed is ever required. Clear abstractions and simple migration paths keep switching costs low and
your choices yours.

**Extensibility and interoperability**
- Clean interfaces and plugin points. Small, composable parts. Bring your own stack: your models, your tools, your
clouds.

## How we work
**High Openness**
- Plans, wins, and failures happen in public. Thoughtful criticism is welcome.

**High Agency**
- Bias to ship. Encourage experiments and weird ideas. You don’t need permission to build.

## What we’re building together
OpenHands is a set of building blocks, not a walled product. Agents, interfaces, and examples you can understand and remix.
Your keyboard, your repo, your rules. We meet you where you are and get out of your way.

## How to participate
- Use OpenHands, file issues and PRs, and share what you learn.
- Start small or go big—examples and experiments are welcome.
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Relationship to All Hands
OpenHands is supported by All Hands AI, Inc.—funding, infrastructure, and full‑time work so the project moves faster.
Three of the earliest major contributors helped found the company:
- Xingyao Wang
- Graham Neubig
- Robert Brennan

Today we use a “benevolent dictator” model for speed and coherence. A future foundation is on the table as we grow.
When incentives ever conflict, we will default to transparency and the long‑term health of the open project.

## Closing
We’re here to amplify your agency. If we ever forget that, remind us—or fork us.
